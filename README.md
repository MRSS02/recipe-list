# RecipeList
  <strong>This is a challenge i did as a test for trying to apply to a internship in my university. The website UI is in Portuguese.</strong>
  <br />
  <br /> This website was creating using the <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> framework and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-toastr">ngx-toastr</a> lib.
  <br /> The default recipe shown in the aplication is taken from <a href="https://receitas.globo.com/bolo-de-fuba-fofinho-5156535d4d3885447000004e.ghtml">this website</a>.  
  <br /> The application is hosted at <a href="https://recipelist.starmain.dev">recipelist.starmain.dev</a>.
